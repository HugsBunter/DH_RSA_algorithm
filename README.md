# **Security Systems Course - Encryption Algorithms Implementation**

This repository serves as an implementation of the **Diffie-Hellman (DH)** and **Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)** encryption algorithms for the Security Systems course at the Technical University of Crete.

## **Purpose**

The primary goal of this project is to provide practical implementations of fundamental encryption algorithms discussed in the Security Systems course. The **Diffie-Hellman** algorithm enables secure key exchange, while the **RSA** algorithm facilitates secure data transmission through public-key cryptography.

## **Contents**

Each folder in this repository contains relevant implementations and resources. For detailed information about each component and usage instructions, please refer to the respective **README.txt** file in each folder.
